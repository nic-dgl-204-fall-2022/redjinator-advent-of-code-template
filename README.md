# Redjinator Advent of code

link: [Day 2 - Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2)

## Overview of problem 1
For this problem we need to calculate the square feet of wrapping paper we're going to need to finish wrapping the remaining presents <br>
by calculating the surface area of each present using measurement data stored locally in a file called `input.txt` as a list of strings <br>

Measurements are a single string containing length, width, and height separated by `"x"`
_See example (below)_

Sample of the first 5 lines in `input.txt`
```
29x13x26
11x11x14
27x2x5
6x10x13
15x19x10
```
### Steps 
* Obtain measurements (length, width, and height) from file and cast values to Int
* Calculate the surface area of each present.
* Calculate the extra slack for each present.
* Repeat for remaining presents

## First solution
To deal with the measurements I read the `input.txt` file using `val input = readInput("filename")` from `Utils.kt` and converting them from `String` to `Int`

### part1
```
fun part1(input: List<String>): Int {
    val inputSplit = input.map { it.split('x') }.map { it.map { it.toInt() }}
    var totalPaper   = 0

    for (i in inputSplit.indices) {
        totalPaper   += getSurfaceArea(inputSplit[i][0], inputSplit[i][1], inputSplit[i][2])
    }
    return totalPaper
}
```

## Overview of problem 2
For this problem we need to calculate the amount of ribbon we're going to need <br>
The ribbon required is the shortest distance around the sides or the smallest perimeter of any single face.



### Steps
* Obtain measurements (length, width, and height) from file and cast values to Int.
* Calculate the smallest perimeter of any face.
* Calculate the volume cubed.

## Second solution













```kotlin
for (value in input) {
    println("We love the smell of bread in Paris!")
}
```

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
